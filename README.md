# Predict which ads contain illicit content

Avito.ru is the largest general classified website in Russia that helps connect buyers with sellers across all Russian territories. There are more than 22 million active ads on Avito and each day a huge number of ads are added or modified. The efficiency of Avito depends heavily on the content quality -- when buyers can quickly find relevant content, sellers can sell their items in hours.

The larger and more popular Avito becomes the more attractive it becomes to sell illicit items or services. Some items that people try to sell are completely illegal while others might seem allowable but are still prohibited by our rules. This is why all new or modified ads are thoroughly moderated by our team of human moderators. The moderators can remove the ad if it conflicts with the Russian legislation or with the internal rules of AVITO.ru. However, with our growth it becomes more and more challenging to thoroughly moderate all ads. This is where machine learning comes into play.

The objective of this challenge is to create a predictive model that will learn from moderators' answers how to classify if an ad contains illicit content or not.
